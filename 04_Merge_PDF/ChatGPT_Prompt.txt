Create a Python script that:

- Takes in the paths for the "cover" and "draft" folders as inputs.
- Iterates through the PDFs in both folders and match the files based on their numeric key (e.g. "1.pdf" from the cover folder with "1 - Letter of Approval.pdf" from the draft folder).
- Merges the matching files in the order of cover PDF first and draft PDF second, and all following pages.
- Saves the merged PDFs to a new "output" folder.
- The merged PDF's file name should be kept the same as the original file name in the draft folder
