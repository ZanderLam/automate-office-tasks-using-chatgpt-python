##################################
Using Python: 
- create an interactive bar chart to visualize the sales generated by country. 
- The chart should be generated using data from the "Data" sheet of the "Financial_Data.xlsx" workbook.
- The countries should be listed on the x-axis, and the total sales for each country should be displayed on the y-axis.
- To create the chart, first group the data by country using the "Country" column (column B) and the "Sales" column (column J) from the data sheet.
- To create the chart, use the color #00008B for the bars and include appropriate titles for the chart, x-axis, and y-axis.
- Save the chart as "Financial Data By Country" in the same directory as the workbook and make sure to include robust error handling in your code
