########################################################################################################################################
Create a Python script that 
- reads data from the sheet "Email_List" in an Excel workbook called "Financial_Data.xlsx".
- The script should use the data in columns A, B, C and D 
        (headers: "Attachment File", "Recipient Name", "Recipient Email" and "CC Email", respectively) to compose and open Outlook emails with different attachments and recipients. 
- The script should locate the attachments in a folder called "Attachments" located in the same directory as the Excel workbook and construct the file path to the attachments.
- The script should use the recipient name from Column B in the email text, and the recipient and CC email addresses from Columns C and D respectively.
- The script should open Outlook emails but should not send them until further actions are taken. Make the Python code robust.
