####################################################################
Please write a Python script that performs the following tasks:
- Accesses the "input" folder and reads all Excel files within it.
- For each file, it retrieves the financial data located in the first worksheet, from column A to P, and excludes any rows with missing values.
- Group the entire data by the "Product" column (C) and sum up the sales column (J) for each group.
- Using the grouped data, the script should create a chart using the seaborn library for each file, and save it in the "charts" folder. If the folder does not exist, the script should create it. . The chart should include a title, appropriate axis labels, and a legend.
- The script should then create a new PowerPoint presentation, insert a slide for each chart, and above the chart, include a title. The title should be the respective excel file name without file extension. And make sure that the chart and title do not overlap
- The PowerPoint presentation should be saved in the same directory as the input files and named "financial_data.pptx".
- The script should be robust and handle any potential errors gracefully, providing appropriate error messages and notifications, and also by including proper error handling mechanisms.
